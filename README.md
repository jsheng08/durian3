# Durian3 Project

This project aims to tackle a few problem and discussion are welcome.

## Problem Statement
As a Durian Lovers in Malaysia, I often get asked a couple of questions.
(1) Where do I find durian stall that is around me?
(2) What is the price that I should be expecting when visiting a local durian stall?
(3) How do I know that the durian I am seeing is the breed?
(4) How do I tell a good durian from a bad one?

The problem (1) and (2) can be solved with an app that crowd source the price and durian stall that you have visited. 
The stall owner can also update their price on the platform. By averaging the price, we are able to roughly get an idea of what a durian will most likely cost in the market.

(3) and (4) This is something that machine learning can help with.
A durian is often identified based on the color of the thorn, the shape of the thorn, the gap between the thorn, the overall shape of the durian, the color of the shell and some by the weight to determine the grade of the durian. Different grade can have different price range and that this project can train a model to identify the type of the durian and an estimation of the grade of the durian.

## Projects
The project should be broken down into multiple phases
### Phase 1
(1) User is able to create a stall
(2) User is able to update the price of a durian species at the stall
(3) User is able to upload picture of the durian and tag the species as well as if it is ( seed, flesh, husk )
(4) User should be able to view the average price of the durian in the stall as well as their historical price
### Phase 2
(1) Machine Learning should kick in and use the pictures uploaded to train a DL model on the durian
(2) Prediction and corelation of pricing kicks in
